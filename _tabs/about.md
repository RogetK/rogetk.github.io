## Who am I?

Hi, my name is Roget, I'm a currently software engineer with experience in 
wireless communications research and embedded systems in both academic and 
industrial environments. I'm currently a software engineer at Active Silicon
working with embedded linux for computer vision hardware!

## Hobbies!

### Table Tennis!
I love playing table tennis and have been playing for almost 15 years, 
playing at various levels of competition in the UK! 

### Coffee
Coffee is essential to be converted to code! I really enjoy specialty coffees, 
especially lighter roasts with my current favourite coffees being natural
process Ethiopian varietals which are super fruity and aromatic. My home
coffee gear include, a Commandante C40, DF64 with SSP multipurpose, v60 and 
Sage Barista Pro. Favourite coffee shop is Kafei Bristol, give them a visit
if you are ever in the city!

### Electronics
I have a wide interest in hobby electronics and programming, I've been building 
various mechanical keyboards since 2019. I also have built a homelab with 
various servers running home services, hypvervisors and more!


## Education and Work
I studied Computer Science and Electronics at the University of Bristol where
I graduated with an upper second class degree (2:1). During this time I studied
wireless communications and protocols extensively during my latter years and
during this time I spent over a year at Toshiba Research Europe conducting 
research around this area and doing development work on various 
mico-controllers and systems. I then started a PhD on wireless technologies in 
late 2020 but have since suspended my research to explore new opportunities.
