wireless communications research and embedded systems in both academic and 
industrial environments. I'm currently a software engineer at Active Silicon

## Hobbies!

### Table Tennis!
I love playing table tennis and have been playing for almost 15 years, 
playing at various levels of competition in the UK! 

### Coffee
Coffee is essential to be converted to code! I really enjoy specialty coffees, 
especially lighter roasts with my current favourite coffees being natural
process Ethiopian varietals which are super fruity and aromatic. My home
coffee gear include, a Commandante C40, DF64 with SSP multipurpose, v60 and 
Sage Barista Pro. Favourite coffee shop is Kafei Bristol, give them a visit
if you are ever in the city!

### Electronics
I have a wide interest in hobby electronics and programming, I've been building 
various mechanical keyboards since 2019. I also have built a homelab with 
various servers running home services, hypvervisors and more!
